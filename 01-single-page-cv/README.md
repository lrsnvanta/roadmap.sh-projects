# Resources and Opinions
I know the project said just use HTML, I just can't help myself add a little CSS (just using style tag inside HTML not as an external file).
You can check out some of these resources to help your HTML/CSS knowledge:
1) https://devdocs.io/html/
2) https://devdocs.io/css/
3) https://devdocs.io/css/css_flexible_box_layout/basic_concepts_of_flexbox
